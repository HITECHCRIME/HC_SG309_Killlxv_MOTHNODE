## Lyrics

```


See...  / Crude... Dust on the ground 
i crave that i can’t raise the faith and
grit in my lungs i am dying again 
day after day, for truth, for the sins 
(what) i’ve told yesterday crushed in my hands
I reign supreme I reign supreme
Say what you did not mean... at all. 
Descend into Feelings, just swirling around your souls
My signs are carved on stones deep in the tombs
So deep into ground i cannot survive
I owe it to the dust and the empty chambers 
Stay there to the end in the endless spiral 
Helpless but destined to be under the ground
make it last my grit on revival
God’s dead carcass is rotten 
My faith is alive yet 
but easily forgotten
yet i knew these thorns so pierced 
Fire the source of all suffering 
Beginning and end is what I bestowed on my life of the painless mind and the
Flesh is my utmost treat
I’ve got no reason to be
