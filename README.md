KILLLXV

I sigh with the death on my face
I walk around with a pair of blades
I cut and I fuck same pace
Got blood on my face I fuck with the taste
Better stay away or you'll be erased
Cuz I walk around with a pair of blades
And I cut and I fuck same pace
Betta (start) counting your days (you're) gonna be my sex slave

Like that white witch pull me out of black smoke ya. 
Give me more misery and put me out of hope
Leave her in a casket let her die slow
Half a dozen hexes on my past hoe
Grippin that flesh and rip out the bones
Cut into pieces and feed her to dogs
Defying the laws they say I'm a god aye
They say I'm a god yuh

MOTHNODE

I owe it to dust and the empty chambers 
Stay there to the very end in an endless spiral 
Make it last my grit on revival
It's a fresh spit, it's a fresh spit ye

God is dead carcass is rotten 
My faith is alive but it's easily forgotten
I'm under the bottom ya
But I rise with the dust on the ground

I crave that i can’t raise the faith 
It's the grit in my lungs and i am dying again 
Day after day, for the truth, for the sins 
What i’ve gave yesterday crushed in my hands ey

Say what you did not mean... at all
I drop into feelings just swirling around 
My signs still carved into the stones in the tombs
so deep into the ground, i cannot survive

yet i knew these thorns so pierced 
Fire the source of all suffering 
Beginning and end is what I bestowed on my life of the painless mind and the
Flesh is my utmost treat
I’ve got no reason to be


-------

i crave that i can’t raise the faith 
the grit in my lungs and i am dying again 
day after day, for truth, for the sins 
what i’ve gave yesterday still crushed in my hands ye
Say what you did not mean... at all. 
Descend into Feelings, just swirling around 
My signs still carved on stones 
deep in the tombs
So deep into the ground

See...  / Crude... Dust on the ground 
i crave that i can’t raise the faith and
grit in my lungs i am dying again 
day after day, for truth, for the sins 
(what) i’ve told yesterday crushed in my hands
I reign supreme I reign supreme
Say what you did not mean... at all. 
Descend into Feelings, just swirling around your souls
My signs are carved on stones deep in the tombs
So deep into ground i cannot survive
I owe it to the dust and the empty chambers 
Stay there to the end in the endless spiral 
Helpless but destined to be under the ground
make it last my grit on revival
God’s dead carcass is rotten 
My faith is alive yet but easily forgotten
